# StatusUpdate
A very simple "Social Media" application (similar in concept to Twitter). This is a serverless cloud application built using Microsoft Azure that allows users to compose "status updates", to follow other users, to see the statuses from the users that they follow and to search for tweets and users. It is a Web application (HTML, CSS + JavaScript) whose backend is based on Azure Functions, an event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform provided by Microsoft.  To build this project, you will need to use Azure Functions, in conjunction with other Azure services such as Azure Table Storage.
